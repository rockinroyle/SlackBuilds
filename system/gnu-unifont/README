The GNU unifont has a glyph for every printable code point in the
Unicode Basic Multilinguial Plane(BMP). The BMP is the first Unicode
"plane" of 65,536(16bit) code points, and includes character encoding
for most of the world's modern scripts.

This package installs precompiled fonts only.

By default, the package will include TTF (TrueType), PCF (X Window bitmap)
and PSF (console) fonts. This can be changed using FONTFORMATS environment
variable. Its default value is "ttf,pcf,psf". For example, setting
FONTFORMATS=pcf,psf will include only PCF and PSF fonts.
