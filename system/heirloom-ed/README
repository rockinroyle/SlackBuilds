heirloom-ed is a version of the standard text editor derived from
the original UNIX source code released by Caldera and Sun and
collected under The Heirloom Toolchest project's umbrella.

This SlackBuild will install ed under name heirloom-ed in
order to neither conflict with GNU ed as supplied by
Slackware nor use PATH overrides created by other heirloom
SlackBuilds.
