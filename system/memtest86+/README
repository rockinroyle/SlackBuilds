Memtest86+ is thorough, stand alone memory test for Intel/AMD x86
architecture systems.  BIOS based memory tests are only a quick check
and often miss failures that are detected by Memtest86+.

Compilation may fail on 64-bit Slackware due to missing
/usr/include/gnu/stubs-32.h from glibc.  If you experience this problem,
copy that file from stubs-64.h in the same directory (or create a symlink),
and you may delete your copy/symlink after you have created the package.

This package installs a bootable image to /boot/memtest86+.bin
which is similar to the kernel images in the same directory.


LILO users:  Append this to your /etc/lilo.conf:

  image = /boot/memtest86+.bin
    label = memtest86+

Then run `/sbin/lilo` to update the boot loader.
Don't forget to re-run `/sbin/lilo` if you upgrade this package.


GRUB 2 users:  Append something like this to your /etc/grub.d/40_custom:

  menuentry 'memtest86+' {
      linux16 (hd0,1)/boot/memtest86+.bin
  }

Then run `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg` to update the boot menu.


GRUB Legacy users:  Append something like this to your /boot/grub/menu.lst:

  title memtest86+
      kernel (hd0,0)/boot/memtest86+.bin


See /usr/doc/memtest86+-$VERSION/README for more info.
