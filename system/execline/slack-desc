# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

execline: The execlineb program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a
execline: text file; the other commands are essentially useful inside an
execline: execlineb script. execline is as powerful as a shell: it features
execline: conditional loops, getopt-style option handling, filename globbing,
execline: and more. Meanwhile, its syntax is far more logic and predictable
execline: than the shell's syntax, and has no security issues.
