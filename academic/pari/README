PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast computations
in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, elliptic curves,
modular forms, L functions...), but also contains a large number of other
useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices,
polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of transcendental
functions. PARI is also available as a C library to allow for faster
computations.

The build produces a singlethreaded gp binary. If a multithreaded version is
wanted "--mt=pthread" has to be added as a Configure argument. This however
created instability in the ploth-function and has therefore been ignored.
