# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

samtools: samtools (Sequence Alignment/Map Tools)
samtools:
samtools: SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format is a generic format for
samtools: storing large nucleotide sequence alignments. The original samtools 
samtools: package has been split into three separate but tightly coordinated 
samtools: projects: htslib (C-library for handling high-throughput sequencing 
samtools: data); samtools (for handling SAM, BAM, CRAM) and bcftools (for 
samtools: handling VCF, BCF). Both samtools and bcftools are set up to use
samtools: system-wide installed hstlib sources.
