Rakudo Perl 6 is a production-ready, stable implementation of the Perl
6 programming language.

Information on Perl 6 can be found at https://www.perl6.org/.

Install the perl6-Readline package or rlwrap to enable command line
editing in the perl6 interpreter.


Optional Dependencies

By default, Rakudo is built with support for MoarVM. The JVM backend is
experimental and requires JDK 8.
