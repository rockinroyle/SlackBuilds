NQP, short for "Not Quite Perl", is a lightweight Perl 6-like
environment for virtual machines. NQP is designed to be very small (as
compared with, say, perl6 or Rakudo) and is focused on being a
high-level way to create compilers and libraries for MoarVM, the JVM,
and others.

By default, support for MoarVM is built. The JVM backend is experimental
and requires JDK 8.

   BACKENDS=moar,jvm ./nqp.SlackBuild

Run the tests with:

   MAKETEST=yes ./nqp.SlackBuild
