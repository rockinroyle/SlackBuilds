bozohttpd (simple and lightweight HTTP server)

bozohttpd is a small and secure HTTP version 1.1 server. Its main
feature is the lack of features, reducing the code size and improving
verifiability. It supports CGI/1.1, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/0.9, ~user
translations, virtual hosting support, as well as multiple IP-based
servers on a single machine. It is capable of serving pages via the
IPv6 protocol. bozohttpd features SSL support. By design, there is no
configuration file: all options are provided as command-line arguments.

bozohttpd is mainly intended to be run via inetd (see bozohttpd(8)),
but is capable of running as a standalone daemon (the -b option). There
is no startup script for daemon mode, but you can launch bozohttpd
from /etc/rc.d/rc.local.

Optional dependency: lua

bozohttpd can be built with support for dynamic content using Lua. This
isn't needed for running CGI scripts that happen to be written in Lua.
It's for embedding a Lua interpreter in bozohttpd, in the style of
Apache's mod_php or mod_perl.

If lua is installed when the script is run, bozohttpd will be built with
Lua support automatically. If you have lua installed but don't want to
build bozohttpd with it, export LUA=no in the environment before running
the script.

Without Lua support, the -L option to bozohttpd will not work.
