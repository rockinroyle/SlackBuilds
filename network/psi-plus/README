Development branch of Psi XMPP client by psi-dev@conference.jabber.ru

NOTE This is intended for advanced users and developers.
NOTE This can coexist with the stable psi package.

In 2009 a Psi fork named Psi+ was started. Project purposes are: implementation
of new features, writing of patches and plugins for transferring them to
upstream. As of 2017 the most of active Psi+ developers have become official
Psi developers, but Psi+ still has a number of unique features. From developers
point of view Psi+ is just a development branch of Psi IM client which is
hosted at separate git repositories and for which rolling release development
model is used.
