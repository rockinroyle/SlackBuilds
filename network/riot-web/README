riot-web (Riot.im for web)

Riot (formerly known as Vector) is a Matrix web client built using the Matrix
protocol.

Riot gathers all your conversations and app integrations (e.g. GitHub, Slack)
into one single app.

Built around group chatrooms, Riot lets you share messages, images, videos
and files - interact with your tools and access all your different communities
under one roof.

Another great feature of Riot/Matrix is the federated or decentralised structure.
Everyone can set up a Matrix server to serve rooms and users can communicate with
other users on other Matrix servers around the World.

Now with end-to-end encryption using the Olm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets
, and ensuring that only explicitly authorized devices can participate in a
conversation.

This is a packaging of the pre-built released version of Riot (on Github).
You should use your favourite web browser to enjoy it. Type your browser name
before before run this script:

	BROWSER=firefox ./riot-web.Slackbuild
