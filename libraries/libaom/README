AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) is an Open Source video codec desgined for
video transmission over the Internet. AV1 is planned to surpass
VP9 and also to eventually be a competitor with HEVC/H.265.

This libaom SlackBuild builds two applications:

  1. aomenc: an AV1 encoder
  2. aomdec: an AV1 decoder

As well as making libraries available for those who wish to build
an AV1 encoder with a recent FFmpeg by specifying: '--enable-libaom'
in the FFmpeg ./configure string.
