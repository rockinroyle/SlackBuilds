Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework.  Qt's
primary feature is its rich set of widgets that provide
standard GUI functionality.

The following are optional dependencies that Qt will link
against if they are detected at build time:

============================================================

OPTIONS

To build the documentation pass DOCS=yes to the SlackBuild:

  DOCS=yes ./qt5.SlackBuild

To build the examples pass EXAMPLES=yes to the SlackBuild:

  EXAMPLES=yes ./qt5.SlackBuild

NOTE

Building the documentation and examples creates a
significantly larger package.


ROUGH SIZE GUIDE

Package size:

  Qt alone:                              102M
  With documentation:                    339M
  With examples:                         391M
  With both documentation and examples:  628M

Minumum working space needed (size of source and package
directories at end of build):

  Qt alone:                              5018M
  With documentation:                    6197M
  With examples:                         6388M
  With both documentation and examples:  7604M


To build support for proprietary media codecs pass
PROPRIETARY_CODECS=yes to the SlackBuild (this will produce
a non-redistributable package in some countries):

  PROPRIETARY_CODECS=yes ./qt5.SlackBuild

To disable support for pulseaudio pass PULSEAUDIO=no to the
SlackBuild:

  PULSEAUDIO=no ./qt5.SlackBuild

Qt will automatically detect if it is not installed at build
time and not provide support for it.


============================================================

NOTE

After upgrading Qt5 it is important to rebuild qt5ct too, if
it is installed, or some applications may not display or
function correctly.

There is a qt5-legacy (5.7.1) SlackBuild that is available
for older applications that do not run correctly with this
version. However it will not coexist with this version.

Please report any problems about applications that don't
work correctly to the Qt5 maintainer or to the mailing list.
