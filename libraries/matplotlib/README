Matplotlib strives to produce publication quality 2D graphics for
interactive graphing, scientific publishing, user interface
development and web application servers targeting multiple user
interfaces and hardcopy output formats.  The 'pylab' mode
of ipython uses matplotlib to emulate matlab graphics.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES: pytest, mock, ffmpeg/avconv, Inkscape

NOTES: If you want to enable the optional subpackages tests and
       toolkits_tests you need to set the variable ENABLE_TESTS
       to "yes" and make sure that pytest, mock, ffmpeg/avconv
       and Inkscape are already installed. Besides ffmpeg/avconv
       are also needed if you wish better support of animation
       output formats.
