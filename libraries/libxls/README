libxls - Extract Cell Data From Excel xls files

This library can read Excel .xls files and allow you to access cell
values and retrieve other information (like the worksheet properties).

There is a utility to convert an excel file to CSV format, or to
formatted HTML (see the test directory).

libxls2csv test.xls > test.csv
