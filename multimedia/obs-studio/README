This project is a rewrite of what was formerly known as "Open Broadcaster Software", software originally designed for recording and streaming live video content, efficiently.

For full functionality, plug-ins using jack-audio-connection-kit and vlc will be constructed if those packages (all available at SBo) are detected at build time.

Another optional build requirement is the mbedtls package which is used to provide RTMPS support. However it will be disabled unless at least version 2.7.0 of the mbedtls package is detected at build time.
