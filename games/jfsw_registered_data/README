jfsw_registered_data (game data from full version of Shadow Warrior)

This is the full/registered version of Shadow Warrior, for use with the
jfsw game engine.

Shadow Warrior is a first-person shooter video game developed by 3D
Realms and published by GT Interactive Software. The shareware version
was released for the PC on May 13, 1997, while the full version was
released on August 31, 1997. Shadow Warrior was developed using Ken
Silverman's Build engine.

The jfsw launcher supports both the demo version (jfsw_demo_data) and the
full version (jfsw_registered_data). Since the full version includes the
levels from the demo version (as Episode 1), there's no need to install
both on the same system, although this is supported.
