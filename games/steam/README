Steam is an internet-based digital distribution, digital rights management,
multiplayer, and social networking platform developed by Valve Corporation.
Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games on
multiple computers, and community features such as friends lists and groups,
cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality.

Depending on the game being played and hardware being used, some games may
benefit by inclusion of flashplayer-plugin and btxc_dxtn packages from SBo.

A multilib installation is required to run steam.
