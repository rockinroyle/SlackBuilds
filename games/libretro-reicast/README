Reicast is an Sega Dreamcast and Sega Naomi video game system emulator
that can be used as a libretro core.

The Dreamcast BIOS files are required to run Reicast.

* dc/dc_boot.bin
* dc/dc_flash.bin

The Sega Naomi BIOS file is required to run Naomi games.

* dc/naomi_boot.bin

To build Reicast OIT with the newer OpenGL 4.3 renderer use:
  OIT=1 ./libretro-reicast.SlackBuild

When building the OpgnGL 3 Reicast core it can be built with an older
and more compatbile OpenGL 2 code path instead by using:
  GL2=1 ./libretro-reicast.SlackBuild

Building Reicast with OpenGL 2 support should only be done if required
by your video card.

Reicast OIT will require an OpenGL compatibility profile to work
correctly.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./libretro-reicast.SlackBuild
