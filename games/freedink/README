Freedink is a free role playing game in real time. You take
control of Dink Smallwood and guide him through his many adventures.
There are many battles to be fought and riddles to be solved.
You can install additional adventures through additional D-Mods
which are available at

  https://www.dinknetwork.com

Optional dependency:
- upx
  If upx is installed on the system then it is automatically
  detected and considered at compile time.

  If for some reason this is not desired then the script
  should be called as

    ENABLE_UPX=no ./freedink.Slackbuild

  If UPX resides in a non-standard location then it
  can be provided by setting

    UPX=/path/to/upx ./freedink.Slackbuild

Known issues:
- Freedink might start in a maximized, not resizable window. Parts of
  it may be outside the Desktop. If this happens then start the
  program from CLI in windowed mode:

    freedink -i -w

  Afterwards you can switch to fullscreen by pressing Alt+Enter.

- Some midi files may not play. The game is still playable
  and the sound effects are all there but music may not
  always be available.
