Apache NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 9.0

Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 is the Apache NetBeans incubator
release of the NetBeans Java SE IDE, i.e., the NetBeans Platform that
underpins NetBeans IDE, together with all the features and tools
applicable to general Java development - including Java Swing,
JavaFX, and the support created specifically for Java 9,
i.e., JShell, JLink, and Jigsaw.

NOTE:

  ****
  UPGRADING: If you come across an error opening your projects,
  check the files in the folder /opt/netbeans/etc.
  If you haven't done modifications in those files, overwrite
  them with new.
  ****

  Apache NetBeans 9.0 only supports Java SE and does not support
  Java EE / Jakarta EE. The process donating Java EE / Jakarta EE
  module for Apache NetBeans is still under way.
