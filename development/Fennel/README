Fennel is a programming language that brings together the speed, simplicity,
and reach of Lua with the flexibility of a lisp syntax and macro system.

* Full Lua compatibilty: Easily call any Lua function or library from Fennel and vice-versa.
* Zero overhead: Compiled code should be just as or more efficient than hand-written Lua.
* Compile-time macros: Ship compiled code with no runtime dependency on Fennel.
* Embeddable: Fennel is a one-file library as well as an executable. Embed it in other
  programs to support runtime extensibility and interactive development.

Anywhere you can run Lua code, you can run Fennel code.

Optional Dependency:
* lua52, lua53
Default support for all versions of Lua installed before build.
After installation there is "fennel5.2" and "fennel5.3" executable files for the
equivalent versions of Lua installed.

* lua-readline
For history completion
