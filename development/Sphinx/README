Sphinx is a tool that translates a set of reStructuredText source files into
various output formats, including HTML, ePub, LaTeX and plain text. Sphinx was
originally created for the Python documentation, but it has excellent
facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages.

All Sphinx dependencies must be built with Python 3 support, which usually just
means making sure that python3 is installed before building them.
