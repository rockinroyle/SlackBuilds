bed (ncurses-based adjustable data format binary/hex editor)

Bed is a binary editor that supports editing/viewing data in a wide
variety of formats, including ASCII, unsigned and signed integers, float,
bit-flags, bit-fields, labels, EBCDIC and time_t. Different sizes and
byte orderings are possible. Data types can be used in structures. Other
data formats, filters and procedures can be defined in plugins.

Notes:

- bed starts up in Ascii input mode. Press F7 to switch to "Digit-Hex" entry
  mode. If this doesn't work, see the next note.

- bed makes extensive use of Meta key combinations and the F-keys.
  It's pretty sensitive to the terminal type and $TERM setting being used.
  See README_SBo.txt if you have trouble with the keyboard commands.
