Gambas is a free IDE based on a Basic interpreter with object
extensions, a bit like Visual Basic. With Gambas, you can quickly
design your program GUI with Qt4 or GTK+, access MySQL, PostgreSQL,
ODBC and SQLite databases, pilot applications with D-Bus, translate
your program into any language, create network applications easily,
make 3D OpenGL applications, make CGI web applications, and so on.

alure, gtkglext, imlib2, unixODBC, sqlite2, postgresql, sdl2_image,
sdl2_ttf, sdl2_mixer and qt5-webkit are optional dependencies.
You should uninstall any present version of gambas before creating
this package.

It can create slackware packages of your programs, but only the
noarch version contains the program.
