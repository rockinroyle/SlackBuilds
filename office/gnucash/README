freely licensed under the GNU GPL and available for GNU/Linux, BSD,
Solaris, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.

Designed to be easy to use, yet powerful and flexible, GnuCash
allows you to track bank accounts, stocks, income and expenses.
As quick and intuitive to use as a checkbook register, it is based
on professional accounting principles to ensure balanced books and
accurate reports.

The dependencies webkitgtk, goffice0.8 and libgnomecanvas have been
dropped, with webkit2gtk, python3, and gtest being the new dependencies.

Pass OFX="yes" for OFX (USA) (requies libofx)
Pass AQ="yes" to enable aqbanking (Germany) (requires aqbanking)
Pass WITHPYTHON="yes" to enable Python bindings for report gereration.

If you want the SQL database integration, you must first have libdbi
and libdbi-drivers installed (with postgresql support), and then pass
the DBI="yes" flag.

NOTE:  You must remove any previous installation of Gnucash before
running this script, otherwise the build will fail.

This script builds version 3.x which is now considered stable by the
upstream developers.  If you need the old stable 2.6.x series, please
