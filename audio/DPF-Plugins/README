Collection of DPF-based plugins from DISTRHO.

These come in LADSPA, DSSI, LV2 and VST2 formats, namely
  glBars
  Kars
  Max-Gen examples (MaBitcrush, MaFreeverb, MaGigaverb, MaPitchshift)
  Mini-Series (3BandEQ. 3BandSplitter, PingPongPan)
  ndc-Plugs (Amplitude Imposer, Cycle Shifter, Soul Force)
  MVerb
  Nekobi
  ProM

LV2_ONLY=yes may be set to ommit building ladspa, dssi and vst plugins.

Optional dependencies: jack,dssi,projectM

This build conflicts with "distrho-mini-series" from SBo, as that build
is a subset of DPF-Plugins.
