This project aims to ease the usage of legacy, non JACK enabled
applications, in a JACK MIDI enabled system, when using jack2 or
jack-audio-connection kit.

Typical usecase is to e.g. connect a software synth like
bristol/azr3 with qtractor/seq24, or even connect midi hardware
with jack applications.
The jack-audio-connection kit already contains parts of the
a2jmidid code.

This requires one of the jack varieties.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
